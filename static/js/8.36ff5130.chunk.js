My primary job functions are as a data scientist and software engineer.\r\n\r\nI am available to consult on interesting projects. I am particularly interested in social impact, education, inclusivity, and space. I enjoy advising companies and may even be available for pro-bono work depending on the time commitment and the project. If you would like to arrange a meeting, I am based in New York but travel to the San Francisco Bay Area frequently.\r\n\r\n# Currently\r\n\r\nAt Deloitte I have learned how to build teams and manage people, build relationships with customers, sell enterprise products, and build on-line predictive models for production environments. I've also learned how to build and maintain large web applications (see [deloitte.com](https://www2.deloitte.com/ui/en.html)).\r\n\r\n# Some history\r\n\r\n- My parents put a computer in my bedroom in 1998 when I was 3. It was an old Tandy that ran MS-DOS. My favorite games were Street Rod 2, Wolfenstein 3D, and Tom and Jerry. It had a mechanical keyboard and a turbo button. To this day, I still don't know what pressing the turbo button really did.\r\n\r\n- We subscribed to Digit in 2002. I still remember installing it from a compact disk onto our brand new HCL Desktop. It took years for me to send my first email.\r\n\r\n- In the summer of 2003, my uncle purchased [NeedForSpeed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed) from [Media Play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Play) and installed it on my mom's work computer. I might have endangered her business by using her computer too much.\r\n\r\n- At 7, I discovered the mini-games hidden in Microsoft Office. I also beat Minesweeper on expert for the first time.\r\n\r\n- At 8, my parents bought me a Sony Mavica MVC-FD71 digital camera after I stole their SLR one too many times. It could fit 10 images to a floppy disk at a 0.3MP resolution. I still have it and it still works. I've been taking photographs ever since, now with a Nikon D750, D800, and occasionally with a Mamiya 6II.\r\n\r\n- At 10, I built my first website with Microsoft FrontPage on our Pentium IV [Gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway,_Inc.). My website was terrible.\r\n\r\n- I was 11 when I built my first [Tesla Coil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_coil) (without the permission of my parents). Over the next few years, I built several more including one of the first audio modulated coils and one of the first DRSSTCs.\r\n\r\n- When I was 12, I started my gaming business by colleting various kinds of games and built game stations with friends, installing play-stations, desktops, and with a lot of patience. I was unstoppable.\r\n\r\n- At 13, I went to Planetarium and fell in love. I went back two more times and promised myself that I'd work in space. I've since helped build three generations of satellites and have tangentially worked on two more.\r\n\r\n- At 14, I was almost expelled for finding a backdoor into my high school's file server and telling everyone but the faculty members about it. Later that year, I figured out how to turn off the internet firewall by editing system registry keys. I anonymously shared my work months later.\r\n\r\n- At 16, I participated in a National Olympiads in Delhi, India. Since then, I've gone back almost every year.\r\n\r\n- 14 - 17, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Counter Strike Source, Command and Conquer 3, Halo 2, and Age of Empires 3.\r\n\r\n- At 18, In the summer before college, my friends and I started playing [Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess(game)). We went on to start over 8 teams in the [+2 College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/) including the [Chess Society](https://www.facebook.com/). At our height, we were ranked third in the Odisha Chess contests. Although I don't play anymore, you can still see pictures of me with friends while wearing a chess camp t-shirt on facebook.\r\n\r\n- At 19, I took my first graduate course and built my first line-follower-bot.\r\n\r\n- At 20, I coauthored a grant to build a satellite and managed a 60+ person team through the end of undergrad. You can read more about that [here](https://ubnl.space/glados/).\r\n\r\nYou can ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.\r\n\r\n# I like\r\n\r\n- Football\r\n- Sailing and the sea\r\n- Space\r\n- Summer\r\n- [Books](https://www.goodreads.com)\r\n- Colored pencils (Faber-Castell Polychromos)\r\n- Podcasts ([The Daily](https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily), [Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/), [The Indicator](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510325/the-indicator-from-planet-money), [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/episodes/), [The Economist](http://radio.economist.com/), [Radiolab](https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/radiolab), [Hidden Brain](https://www.npr.org/series/423302056/hidden-brain), [Inquiring Minds](https://inquiring.show), and others)\r\n- [Good design](/)\r\n- [Art](https://instagram.com/)\r\n\r\n# Travel / Geography\r\n\r\n- I am from originally from Odisha, India. I have since lived in\r\nRourkela, Hyderabad, Pune, and Mumbai.\r\n\r\n- I've been to ~ 50 cities, some of which I have forgotten, and many of which I would like to revisit.\r\n\r\n- In 2016, I visited: Puri, Sambalpur, Bhubaneswar, Rourkela, Ludhiana, Amritsar.\r\n\r\n- In 2017, I visited: Punjab, Kolkata.\r\n\r\n- In 2018, I visited: Kharagpur, Digha, Nainital, Delhi, Hyderbad.\r\n\r\n- In 2019, I visited: Ooty, Banagalore, Chennai, and Coimbatore.\r\n\r\n- In 2020, I stayed in Bhubaneswar.\r\n\r\n- I am a Trekking enthusiast.\r\n\r\n# Fun facts\r\n\r\n- I have a list of thousands of ideas, like creating gadgets for pets.\r\n- I almost always have a sketchbook with me.\r\n- I can locate every country on a map.\r\n- I operate a [small angel fund](http://) with terrible returns.\r\n- I break about 30 traffic laws on a [skateboard](https://), [bike](https://), [cycle](https:), or [Roller Skates](https://) every single day.\r\n- I added this page because so many people complained that my site was just a resume.\r\n\r\n# I dream of\r\n\r\n- always finding inspiration.\r\n- enabling a brighter future.\r\n- doing better.\r\n- no one checking the commit history for earlier drafts of this file.\r\n",h=d.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,c=function(e){var t=Object.assign({},e);return Object(a.jsx)(i.b,Object(r.a)({},t))};t.default=function(){return Object(a.jsx)(l.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Sourav Sahoo",children:Object(a.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(a.jsx)("header",{children:Object(a.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(a.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(a.jsx)(i.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(a.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",h," words)"]})]})}),Object(a.jsx)(s.a,{source:d,renderers:{Link:c},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
